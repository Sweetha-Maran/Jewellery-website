                <p>Jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. Gemstones and similar materials such as amber
                    and coral, precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often been
                    important. In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material
                    properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every
                    body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and even genital jewellery. In modern European culture the
                    amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in
                    European culture.Jewellery (or jewelry in American English) consists of decorative items worn for
                    personal adornment such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks.
